title: "Los Angeles: The City and the Library"
---

_Los Angeles: The City and the Library_ is a lower-division composition class that trains students in research and writing, all the while asking them to engage the city around them through direct encounter and library research. The capstone of the class requires students to work directly with the Library’s archives, touching and pondering evidence of the city's past.

This site hosts images of those archival artifacts as well as the students’ annotations of the material, cross-referenced by subject and geography. It represents a collaboration between UCLA Writing Programs and the UCLA Library. The class began in Fall 2013, the digital project in Fall 2015; both are ongoing.

Colleen Jaurretche is the project editor and course instructor. The project uses the [Flâneur](https://github.com/kirschbombe/flaneur) framework developed by Dawn Childress & Niqui O'Neill (based on the original [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier) framework developed by Dawn Childress & Nathan Day) and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
