The social climate of Los Angeles in the early 90s was dominated by public outcries against racism, civil injustice, and economic disparity. People from minority backgrounds matched a specific profile shaped by racial discrimination, thus increasingly becoming targets for police discrimination and violence. The LA Youth newspaper, authored by high-school students in the LA county, provided a medium for teenagers who had experienced different forms of racial discrimination to voice their discontent. The paper targeted readers from other high schools who, in this way, were informed of relatable situations within the changing socio-cultural environment of Los Angeles. The source particularly mirrors the experiences of those individuals who decided to press charges in response to their mistreatment by the LAPD. One specific article from June 1990 details an incident of police brutality that occurred in the Pacific Palisades Park, involving two dozen Black and Hispanic adolescents. Another involved the unnecessary physical abuse of two Hispanic boys accused of theft. Lastly, the newspaper highlights the case of a high school boy who was allegedly taken from his classroom and strip-searched for drugs, later discovered to have possessed none. In utilizing such examples, the LA Youth newspaper showcases the underlying issues of injustice and police brutality by the LAPD.

The Pacific Palisades Park incident illustrated the blurred line between the justification and demonization of extreme actions by the police against suspect activity, on the grounds of racial prejudice. When police officers were called on by a park ranger to intervene and stop a group of Black and Latino teenagers from allegedly playing with a horse using their baseball bats, the officers on the scene uttered racial slurs and engaged in the physical abuse of the teenagers. Yet the officers claimed that their actions came as a response to what appeared to be gang-related violence between the teenagers, arguing that their use of baseball bats without any gloves or balls indicated suspicious behavior. The police further supported their claim by noting that one of the teenagers, Gonzalez, was a member of a dance and rap club with strong ties to the High Rolling Crips gang, which had previously threatened LAPD officers in Santa Monica. According to Police Press Officer William Booth, the officers present on the scene were of Black, Hispanic, and white heritage, ruling out some claims of racial prejudice. Nonetheless, the department offered no justification for the brutal treatment of suspects, disregarding the prospect that such treatment may lead to increased defensiveness of disadvantaged teenagers towards the police force. While racial incentives in this incident might not have been particularly clear, the mistreatment of suspects incited hostilities in both the department and the victims, facilitating gang formation and resulting in increased ethnic labelling by the LAPD.

When confronted by the newspaper, police representatives denied that the officers’ actions had been racially motivated. Racism, nonetheless, was undeniably present within the  city’s main law enforcement organization. Mark Fuhrman, the police officer who had found evidence used in the O.J. Simpson trial, grew to infamy after hours of tapes were released featuring him uttering racial slurs. In the tapes he stated “Most real good policemen understand that they would just love to take certain people and just take them to the alley and just blow their brains out. All gang members for one.” Regardless of what LAPD representatives may have said publicly, racism was an undoubtedly potent characteristic of the LAPD in the 1990s. The LA Youth article clearly states that “When a cop sees a white kid, he sees a business manager. When he sees a hispanic kid, he sees a bum” . Unfortunately, this was a common attitude in Los Angeles during the late 20th century. Manufactured evidence, excessive use of force, and witness harassment were all ubiquitous among Los Angeles police officers during the 90s. In 1992, the LAPD alone fired their guns on 162 instances and were found to have committed more than 100 police beatings (Reibstein). The vast majority of these cases targeted members of African-American and Latino communities. The article further explains that this could have been the result of disproportionately violent police responses to any suspected “Gang Violence.” This automatic assumption of present gang brutality by the police created an “Us versus them” mindset, which may be the reason for why police brutality remains prevalent. (Gest and Whitman).

The large extent of racial profiling and numerous incidents of police violence towards minority groups, particularly the Latino and African-American communities, persisted and proliferated in the late 1980s. Following the brutal beating and arrest of African-American taxi driver Rodney King by four white police officers, ethnic tensions escalated. On April 29, 1992, in an extreme response to the jury’s decision to acquit the four police officers, disturbances surfaced in the neighborhood of Florence and Normandie that became known as some of the most violent tumults in the history of California. Over a period of six days, the uprisings caused the loss of 63 lives and over a billion dollars in damage. Only after the intervention of both the California National Guard as well as the US army did the riots finally come to an end. Their message was clear: the presence of racism and violence towards minority groups would no longer be tolerated in the city of Los Angeles.

As illustrated in the LA Youth article, conflicts between the police and various ethnic minority groups were prevalent throughout Los Angeles during the late twentieth century. The social tensions, derived from repeated incidents of the LAPD’s racial profiling, gradually intensified as police brutality put into question the presence of both justice and fair treatment of local communities. Following the events described in the article, riots broke out throughout Los Angeles' neighborhoods that left behind nothing but emotional scars and physical damage. Los Angeles, a city that represents the term ‘melting-pot’ well today, needs to remember these events in order to help build stronger ties between its different ethnic constituents and its legal institutions, in the interest of maintaining citywide congeniality and correspondingly, inter-communal mutual respect.
