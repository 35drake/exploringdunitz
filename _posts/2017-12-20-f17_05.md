Mark Weber, a Californian photographer, shot a series of jazz musicians in the 1970s and 1980s. One notable piece of the collection is an autographed photo of Lester Bowie performing alongside other musicians at The Lighthouse Café, an iconic jazz club in Los Angeles. The photograph centers around a musically passionate Lester Bowie, who leans back at the knees with his trumpet in his mouth; in the foreground, an enthusiastic audience member throws his arms in the air. Additionally, Bowie’s signature scribbled across the photograph makes this artifact especially captivating. In essence, this particular portrait is a prime example of the various musicians that traveled from across the country to experience the vivid Los Angeles Jazz scene.
Sparked in New Orleans in the early twentieth-century, the novel African-American-based style of music spun its way through decades of cultural and social differences. Migrating from one state to another, jazz took the face of its performers. The genre eventually made its mark on Southern California in the 1940s, predominantly centered in Los Angeles’ migrant communities. In 1952, Gerry Mulligan’s Quartet, alongside trumpeter Chet Baker, revolutionized the sound of jazz through an innovative piano-less performance, providing musicians with both work and leisure opportunities. The musical set was considered “the antidote to the highly charged, dynamically intense eastern bebop,” which soon paved the way for the smooth, cool West Coast Jazz (Dickerson 184). The genre had a profound impact on its performers and audience, from the communities it fostered to the lives it brought together. Performers from all over the country sought out the luscious lands of Southern California, keeping the music scene alive even with the downfall of its initial, densely African-American populated community. The few nightclubs that emerged after the 1940s relied heavily on the passion of its musicians and the continuous publication of West Coast Jazz’s livelihood.

In the early 1950s, a tiny club in Hermosa Beach became an unlikely ‘hypocenter’ of the West Coast jazz scene. Similar to what Harlem’s Cotton Club was to the New York jazz scene in the late twenties, The Lighthouse, just spitting distance from the sand, served as the proving ground for a school of West Coast modern sounds (Kohlhaase). As a byproduct of this creative experimentation, customers came from far and wide to the once-struggling ocean-side bar, eager to witness and experience the West Coast Jazz scene. The Lighthouse, first built in 1934, endured multiple ownership changes before John Levine acquired the nightclub in 1948. Together with bassist Howard Rumsey, one of jazz’s champion promoters, the two transformed the floundering business into a locus of postwar California jazz (Tiele).

Rumsey managed all of the club’s music bookings, slowly converting the casual Sunday afternoon jazz performances into 12-hour marathons, and had his top-level house ensemble, The Lighthouse All-Stars, play hard-driving bebop six nights a week (Chawkins). It came as no surprise that the seaside bar caught the interests of many influential jazz musicians; as the 1950s progressed, east coast musicians such as trumpeters Miles Davis and Lester Bowie, saxophonists Benny Golson and Cannonball Adderley, pianist Wynton Kelly, and guitarist Wes Montgomery visited to enjoy or play with Rumsey’s band. In fact, nearly all of the finest west coast jazz musicians of that era had played at The Lighthouse at one time or another (Kohlhaase). To this day, The Lighthouse remains at 30 Pier Avenue, where jazz music still rules at Sunday brunches and the occasional Thursday night-show, booking local musicians, and continuing the club’s historic legacy (Levin).

Lester Bowie, photographed at The Lighthouse, contributed to jazz music in many ways and is immortalized by his new-wave, improvisionist take on the genre. Born on October 11, 1941, the famous trumpeter began studying music under his father’s instruction at age five. He grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and played throughout school and during his stint in the military. Following his service, he relocated to Chicago in 1965 with his wife, Fontella Bass, an R&B vocalist, to pursue his own career in the music industry (Heckman). Bowie quickly became an active member of the jazz community; he joined the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and formed the New York Hot Trumpet Quintet along with other ensembles (Ratliff). Most known for his contributions to the Art Ensemble of Chicago, a jazz band founded in 1968, Bowie possessed an improvisational air to his playing, which accentuated their popularity first in Europe and later in the United States. Experimental Jazz finally had a place in American hearts by the mid-1970s. Bowie’s dedication to playing with his distinctive style and flair contributed to the jazz genre as a whole and left a mark on many artists across all musical disciplines. Attesting to this end, Ben Ratliff writes, “the most famous part of Mr. Bowie’s trumpet language was [his] timbral effects …  that worked their way into the style of almost every self-consciously experimental jazz trumpeter who came after him.” Aside from his unique sound, the famous trumpeter was known for his flattop haircut, clean-shaven goatee, and white lab-coat attire on stage. Despite his lab-coat absent from the photograph, Bowie’s fervent passion for jazz is clearly displayed (Ratliff).
