It is the year 1932 in the United States. The Great Depression has taken a toll on the country and its citizens. People call for change and criticize the incumbent Herbert Hoover - a one-term president whose inaction in solving the economic crisis resulted in a fall in his popularity. Amidst the country’s disarray, the 1932 Olympics offers glamour in contrast to the United States’ economic hardships. The Los Angeles Times covers the commencement of this spectacular event in its July 30th issue - the article of our scrutiny. Our examination will encompass editorial choices during this time in American journalism.

Although several articles focused on foreign countries at this worldwide event, discrimination lay at their core.  The author of the article “Athletes from Thirty-Seven Nations Ready to Go” wrote, “a riot of color in a setting that has never before equaled from the standpoint of beauty and interest,” expressing that the Games gave each country an equal chance to compete; however, it is doubtful that the media viewed all countries equally. Specifically, the newspaper paid particular attention to the Japanese team and praised them for their excellence and kindness. There was even a report about the Japanese five-man boxing team who was very hopeful to win, and another emphasizing the “kindness and child-like courtesy” of the Japanese. Albeit, the newspaper used words like “little lovable brown man” to describe Japanese, presenting them as “tiny and harmless” (Welky 40). The mainstream media often viewed countries like Japan as more inferior by making Japanese “less dangerous” when compared to Americans (Welky 40). Although the newspaper’s overall attitude seemed kind and respectful, the assumption of superiority pervaded the reporting.

As part of the bias in reporting, the paper diminished women athletes.  At the time, women played the role of housewife and mother, having appropriate manners and a delicate nature and most glaringly, being subordinate to men. In the article titled “Athlete Girls Doing Laundry,” the Olympic athletes are labeled as “sweet-faced,” “beautiful and demure,” “the friendliest girls,” “the prettiest girls,” and so forth. It is important to note that the journalist uses “girl” instead of “woman,” further demonstrating the lacking social advancements for women’s status in society.

With the Olympics in full turn, the Los Angeles Times shifted its focus to the Olympians and their events. Articles described the pride of Los Angeles in hosting the Games. Editors for the newspapers centered on not only American athletes, but also those from other countries and their achievements as well. Despite their welcome, many foreign athletes faced resentment from U.S. citizens because of racial ideologies and immigration policies. National and local sports events appeared only in small boxes. The articles paid close attention to the visiting countries from a global perspective, describing their preparation for the Olympics along with politics not involved in the Games.

Newspapers at this time were not corporate owned, carefully crafted works as they are today. The Times was far more “cut and dry”; it was less biased on any side of the political spectrum and did not just reflect interests of the businessmen who owned it. One article covers the German president Paul von Hindenburg’s warnings of Nazi Adolf Hitler.  In April of 1932, Hindenburg defeated Hitler in a presidential race and seized the office for the second time.  Despite his victory, no party claimed the majority of the Reichstag and Hitler’s party maintained their hold on the most seats.  Since no majority was established, Hindenburg was forced to cooperate with Hitler.  Hitler refused to accept any office in the new government other than Chancellor, forcing Hindenburg to reluctantly offer Hitler the powerful position in spite of his warnings in previous months (Jones 358-361).  In hindsight, neutrality in reporting of the rise of the Third Reich was a grave mistake, however, unbiased journalism on many political issues can be beneficial and allow the reader to form their own beliefs as opposed to assuming someone else’s.   

Women are subjected to misrepresentation. The Japanese are labeled inferior through the use of belittling diction. Foreign countries are greeted but not fully accepted. Similarly sharing the welcoming yet competitive nature of the Olympics itself, the Los Angeles Times found the Olympics as yet another opportunity to reinforce social stereotypes and American hegemonism.  Though some of our society’s prejudices have diminished, and we have become more politically correct, the Times’ bias in political reporting has increased.  Many articles of today both report and analyze domestic and foreign issues, thus making it hard for the reader to form their own opinions.  Newspapers teach us to never forget that medium is the message; the Los Angeles Times of 1932 and their editorial choices embody the political and social atmosphere of its time.
