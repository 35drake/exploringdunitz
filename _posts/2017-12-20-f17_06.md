Known for its unforgettable, blood-etched logo, thrilling photography, and explicit prose, Slash magazine served as the printed embodiment of the emergent Los Angeles Punk scene during its short publication run from 1977-1980. With the punk rock movement brewing on a global scale, Steve Samiof and Melanie Nissen created this monthly magazine in Los Angeles to showcase Nissen’s photography and promote the city’s punk rock scene (Martins). Claude “Kickboy Face” Bessy wrote for Slash from 1977 to 1980, and served as the community’s conscience and main supporter by promoting the subculture with his honest stylistic writing (McKenna 5). Following a do it yourself ideology, Slash invited people to write articles and participate in the subculture by publicizing and advertising for the new, up-and-coming local punk rock bands by promoting their concerts and events (Levine 423). With an audience spanning far beyond Los Angeles, Slash Magazine introduced the local punk rock scene and its unique identity to the rest of the world. The global punk rock movement included a multitude of zines from different subcultures; however, Slash differentiated itself by creating a raw and artful aesthetic to document the local subculture (Martins). The cover artist of the May 1978 edition, Alice Bag of The Bags, recalls “Slash was definitely seen as an authority. They had the best documentation. They were the most professional of the publications … For me, it was a big deal when I was on the cover.” Slash provided a template of punk elements to inspire youth and fans to follow and identify with the subculture.
As the magazine that represented the punk scene in Los Angeles, Slash went outside the social expectations of mainstream music by pushing the subgenre’s idea of anti-establishment. Unlike other magazines, Slash lacks the typical organization of advertisements and articles. It served as an “insiders’ report to outsiders,” (Clegg 32) containing interviews, editorials, and advertisements along with unusual elements like comics and crudely written notes. Each issue included an editorial from the main editors of the magazine containing humor and satire, reflecting the personality of punk rock. The next page contained a table of contents and an updated list of bands and concerts in the Los Angeles area, including small-name bands (Samiof 18-22). This feature allowed fans to discover new bands and events, boosting local interest in the punk rock genre. The magazine included comics, drawings, and photographs that strayed outside of the lines in a sporadic and disorderly manner, reflecting the chaotic, anti-establishment ideals of the punk scene. Slash Magazine conducted interviews, often crude and carefree, with celebrated punk bands like The Damned, The Screamers, and X (Levine 423). One of the zine’s first interviews featured members of the Damned, who badmouthed every other punk musician of the time, serves as one example of Slash Magazine’s adherence to uncensored and ruthless journalism (Martins). Wanting to be unassociated with authority, punk rockers voiced unpopular opinions and were not hesitant to speak their minds on what the general public would sometimes consider intolerable subjects. The whole motif and contents of the magazine played a huge role in influencing the Los Angeles region and the followers of the punk rock movement.
As Slash received more and more readers and as the punk rock movement advanced even further, the legacy of Slash Magazine solidified itself in history. With their unique features and well-placed advertisements, once aspiring bands became household names and old, run-down concert venues became landmarks. Venues like the Roxy and the Whisky a Go-Go became home to countless of shows of a new genre and millions of different fans and followers of the Los Angeles punk movement. Readers of Slash and attendees at these concerts wanted to belong to the subculture dressing in the fashion, imitating the mannerisms, and identifying with the soul of the punk scene. With its army of followers and distinct personality, Slash helped establish Los Angeles as one of the meccas of punk rock.
