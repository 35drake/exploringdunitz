Internationally acclaimed actress Marilyn Monroe once stated, “Hollywood is a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty cents.” In 1912, the Hollywood area, famous as the birthplace of modern entertainment and the film industry, began its rapid rise to cultural prominence. By the 1920s, Hollywood emerged as the epicenter of film. From then on, this glamorous little ‘tinseltown’ became the epitome of grandiosity and superficiality. In fact, this image was taken in the center of Hollywood, where all the famous actors and actresses resided at the time.
The title of this image, “First Rain of Season Arrives”, derives from the torrential rainfall that struck Southern California in the last quarter of 1936 (National Weather Service 12). Despite the intense rain streaking across the photo, the two people seem incredibly at ease in the dark, despite the light shining on the water-filled pavement. The moonlight reflects off the water, lighting up the photograph and giving it an ethereal feel, echoing the Hollywood ‘Golden Age’ era of that time. Their outfits exude wealth and their attitudes are charismatic, yet both are humanized by their lack of preparation for such a rain. Their hair and clothing, along with Taylor’s gentlemanly chivalry, typify the 1930s. The photograph is all the more magical for its contradictions. Taylor and Lupino both appear to be illuminated with joy, completely unaware of the horrific floods quickly approaching.
In September of that year, a tropical cyclone tracked northwestward across the Gulf of California, with the remnants tracking northward into western Arizona. Consequently, there was heavy rainfall locally in the mountains surrounding Los Angeles, such as the San Gabriels. In fact, rainfall had been accumulating in these mountains in the months approaching October, when the photo was taken, leading to a sudden influx of floodwater rushing over Los Angeles. As mentioned in the photograph caption, gutters were flooded and drains were clogged, which resulted in the flooded street clearly depicted in the picture.
The image is of Kent Taylor carrying Ida Lupino across a flooded street following a filming session at Paramount Studios on the first rain of the season. Paramount Pictures, originally named the Famous Players Film Company, was founded in 1912 and has become one of the largest and oldest motion picture studios in the world. In 1916, the first official ‘Hollywood movie stars’ were created by its founder, Adolph Zukor. Taylor and Lupino were two such renowned Hollywood figures. Kent Taylor was an American actor who starred in over sixty movies from the 1930s until the 1970s. In 1931, Taylor was offered a deal with Paramount Pictures after becoming one of the first actors to try out a ‘silent sequence’. He became an official Paramount movie star on July 11, 1931, and was one of the inspirations for the name Clark Kent, Superman’s alter-ego. Ida Lupino was the first actress to become a successful director and producer in Hollywood. Lupino starred in 59 movies as well as directed eight movies throughout her 50-year career in the entertainment industry. Lupino is renowned for producing social realism movies which focus on controversial issues; moreover, she goes against the themes presented in traditional Hollywood entertainment. (Grisham 30)
We don’t know which movie was filmed at the time of the photograph; however, both Taylor and Lupino starred in numerous films around that time. In 1935, the two actors landed the leading roles in the movie Smart Girl. Because of the intimacy portrayed in that snapshot of the Hollywood age, this photograph suggests that Taylor and Lupino may have had a relationship of some sort, perhaps stemming from their roles as actors for Paramount Studios and their numerous films in the same timeframe. Ultimately, the photograph embodies the allure of the Hollywood age, with its timeless representation of how film still thrives even in the harshest of conditions. Photography, as an art, defies death; it is a powerful tool for capturing joyful moments like these, preserving the youthful essence of Hollywood in its ‘Golden Age’.
