Spaces will work.

   And so will indents.

To add an image you will use the following text with the exclamation point, brackets, and parentheses. In the brackets you will put in your title. In the parentheses you will put in a link to your image. There is also text there with a special bracket and the word image inside it. Leave this alone!
