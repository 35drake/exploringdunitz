This is the body of your essay. You will copy and paste your essay into here. You will just delete all the text below and put in your own.

Spaces will work.

Indents do not, so just put a space in for each new paragraph.

Formating is very simple in this document. 

To add an image you will use an exclamation point, then a description in brackets, and then the location of the image in parentheses. We will try to store ALL of our images in the GitHub repository.  There is also a little bit of text after the image in the special curly brackets and the word image inside it. Leave this alone! It displays the image in a special viewer so when you click on the image it opens it up in its own viewer and then you can cycle through all the images in this viewer. You can put in as many images as you like. Just always make sure to have the curly brackets afterwards.

![You change this and put in your own Image title](images/example1.jpg)
   {:.image}
You also need provide attribution and or a quick description for the the image. This image was found on the [Public Art in LA website](http://www.publicartinla.com/LA_murals/Hollywood/cat_fairfax.html)
   {:.caption} 

If you do find an image online with the a .jpg extension you can use that URL to display an image as well. But remember if you do this please only use images from well known website because if the website changes or the URL is broken then your image will no longer display! Here is an image from wikipedia.

![Image from Judith Baca's Great Wall of Los Angeles from Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_Los_Angeles#/media/File:Great_Wall_of_Los_Angeles2.jpg)
{:.image}
Again, here is where you would put the caption to describe this image and see that it is from a [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_Los_Angeles#/media/File:Great_Wall_of_Los_Angeles2.jpg)
{:.caption} 

You can continue writing text with images placed after paragraphs. Or, you can save all your images for the end of the essay.
