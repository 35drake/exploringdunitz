Created by Lafayette Ron Hubbard, Scientology is a religious system based on the seeking of self-knowledge and spiritual fulfillment through graded courses of study and training (Reitman, 39). The religious movement was spurred by Hubbard’s bestseller “Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health” where he wrote about the techniques he used to resolve the mental trauma encountered during WWII from serving in the U.S. Naval Reserves (Urban, 26). The group did not become official until February 18, 1954, when incorporation papers were filed in Los Angeles for the Church of Scientology of California, the first official Scientologist organization (Urban, 57). Home to the Church of Scientology International, a block dedicated to its creator called “L. Ron Hubbard Way” and the largest concentration of Scientologists, Los Angeles is the indisputable Scientology capital of the world (Reitman, 67). With its close proximity to Hollywood, Scientology was able to corral famous celebrities, and in turn, use them to promote their religion. In addition to using celebrities, Scientology utilizes marketing tactics such as flyers like this one to expand more effectively than any other religion.
Using elaborate techniques, Scientology attempts to disconnect the human body from the soul, stripping members of their faulty human characteristics (Hubbard, 207). The system rests on two key components: auditing and training (Hubbard, 213). Auditing is the practice where a member of the organization known as an auditor asks a question of another person, known as a preclear and then acknowledges their answer in a non-judgemental form (Hubbard, 219). If auditing was the spiritual counseling on how to be free, training provides the knowledge of how to remain free. This relationship between auditing and training is best explained by the Classification, Gradation and Awareness chart, which can be found on page ten of the widely distributed flyer. Each level is given a grade and lists specific training services for that level. By completing the final grade, the member achieves the state of being Clear. Clear is a spiritual mode of being where a person is no longer affected by engrams, psychological traumas that can have physical effects on the body which arise from negative experiences in the past and also possibly in the life before this one (Hubbard, 65). It is a very important rite of passage and hallmark for those wanting to complete the Bridge to Total Freedom, a metaphor used by the Church signifying total enlightenment.
Auditors are trained in centers known as Saint Hill Organizations, exhibited in the flyer.. The first was founded in Sussex, England in 1961. An important achievement of the Saint Hill period where numerous centers began emerging is the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course (SHBC), which is “considered the single most comprehensive and rigorous training course for budding auditors in the Church,” according to the flyer. Today, the most prominent SHBC center is in Los Angeles, California. Located along L. Ron Hubbard Way, the American Saint Hill Organization continues to teach the SHBC.
The SHBC is both a course guide and a marketing tool used to persuade new members to join Scientology. Appealing to the public, the flyer purposely boasts how the briefing courses are available to anyone regardless of sex, color, creed or age. Using only positive quotes from members of Scientology, the flyer provides a biased view that does not include the steep prices attached to the courses. The sole objective of the flyer is to gain more members. Interested members of Scientology who are unable to pay for more courses have trouble leaving the religion because of relentless propaganda and disruption caused by members of the Church (Urban, 89).
Despite the biased perspectives, Scientology continues to thrive, especially in Hollywood where it has assembled a star-studded roster of followers by aggressively recruiting and pampering them at the Church’s “Celebrity Centers.” Famous members like Tom Cruise and John Travolta contribute to the massive publicity campaigns by presenting Scientology in a glamorous light, masking the harsh reality which includes abusive punishments for errant non-celebrity members at “The Hole,” a prison-like compound in San Jacinto, California (Reitman, 316). These celebrities advocate for the beliefs and practices of Scientology, all the while remaining completely oblivious to the opposite side of the same coin. In addition to this, celebrity scientologists are incredibly well taken care of by the Church. All celebrity scientologists have Personal Public Relations Officers (PPRO) who keep tabs on the celebrities, making sure all their needs are met and most importantly ensuring they do not leave the Church. Many celebrities who have ventured into Scientology must also remain in the Church because of the meticulously kept notes, recordings, and videos from auditing sessions by their respective PPROs, which make for the ideal blackmail material should the need arise (Reitman, 253). Scientology thrives from its mysterious, star-studded appeal, but its cryptic messages have also created its downfall, garnering skepticism and criticism from the public.
