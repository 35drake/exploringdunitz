Exploitation, present for many years in the city of Los Angeles, prevails in dead-end occupations. A prominent example of an oppressed labor force, the janitorial industry continuously endured decades of abuse by employers and lawmakers. Because janitorial occupations lack employment mobility, janitors cannot escape the working class and as a result, remain impoverished. Corporate landlords drained “more than two billion” (Lerner) in funds from middle-class janitors leading to their demotion to non-union, low-wage positions without any healthcare benefits. Despite the horrible working conditions, “workers did not complain about the violations in fear of being fired or deported” (Greenhouse). With underpaid wages, little to no health insurance, neither vacation time nor employee benefits, janitors had a reason to change unbearable conditions (Cranford 389). In the artifact, “Janitors Reach Tentative Deal with Contractors,” the author addresses the five-year contract agreement set by the Los Angeles janitors’ union and janitorial contractors. In 2003, the Los Angeles janitors’ union came to a consensus with janitorial contractors on the topic of paid health insurance (Cleeland). The landmark agreement preceded a 2,000 member strike that pressured employers and contractors to listen to janitors in Los Angeles. It promised a five-year contract that guaranteed family health insurance for all of the janitors under contract throughout the country (Cleeland).

Years of harsh janitorial working conditions catalyzed the passing of the health insurance agreement in 2003. The case of Adolfo Tipaz, a janitor, showcases the intolerable status of his job. According to Tipaz, “the company...never [tells employees their] rights” (Nazario). Janitors regularly worked up to four weeks for free as a “training period” and were not paid overtime. Besides their disregarded wages, companies also compromised employees’ health. In fact, janitors many times were not given gloves or face masks to protect themselves from constant exposure to chemicals, which were sometimes unlabeled or only labeled in English.

Ana Navarette, a union organizer, holds meetings wherever she can, including in parking lots and basements. Since the Justice for Janitors campaign launched, more janitors have become union members. Unions file lawsuits on behalf of the janitors which have resulted in receiving health insurance and higher hourly rates (Nazario). While previously janitors had difficulty organizing, they are now successfully advocating for their rights as employees. Companies that were anti-union attempted to sabotage the workers by sending representatives to vote against unions. Although this initially hurt the union movement, it also angered the workers which led them to fight harder for union representation.

The janitorial unions, led mostly by immigrants and people of color, elevated the occupation from dead-end job to middle-class stepping stone (Lerner). In recent years, they have had much success. In January of 2005, three of California's largest supermarket chains, Safeway, Albertsons and Ralphs agreed “to pay $22.4 million to settle an overtime lawsuit brought on behalf of 2,000 janitors, many of them illegal immigrants” (Greenhouse). Those janitors claimed that they worked seven nights a week receiving just $3.50 an hour. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) helped bring that lawsuit to “pressure contractors to improve wages, to publicize bad working conditions and to advance its efforts to unionize tens of thousands of janitors” (Greenhouse). The janitorial labor force has been able to evolve into a powerful and prominent face of leadership and advocacy because “status and acceptance [were] gained through two sources: the union and the community of janitorial workers” (Yu). While unions have accomplished a lot, there remains more work ahead.
