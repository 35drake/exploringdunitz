The photograph, taken in 1962 for the Los Angeles Times, shows a family in a car pulled over on the side of Aviation Boulevard to watch a United Airlines plane pass overhead. The photograph’s use of foreground and background leads us from the family in the car to the massive airplane flying past, depicted from the family’s point of view. The captivation of the children and adults in the image represent the fascination millions of Americans had with airplanes. Since the commercialization of aviation, people relied on planes for both work and leisure. Aviation Boulevard still exists today in the same location as the photograph. The seven-mile stretch is a major north to south roadway that, as implied by its name, runs adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport (“LAX: Getting Around”).
Though Aviation Boulevard is still present, the airport transformed from a makeshift landing strip for amateur pilots to a bustling center of travel. The area of LAX’s current location was part of a Mexican land grant during the early 1800s. It was common farmland until the 1920s, when a small part of the land near modern day Aviation Boulevard and Imperial Highway emerged as a makeshift landing strip. In 1927, 640 acres of the land, known as Mines Field, was leased for an airport. In 1957, construction of new terminals began, and formed the basis of Los Angeles International Airport as it is today (“LAX: Getting Around”).
The photograph depicts one of United’s many massive jetliners operating at LAX. Prior to 1962, when the image was captured, United Airlines merged with Capital Airlines to become one of the largest carriers in the world. Reorganization of the company in 1968-69 led to the creation of the UAL Corporation. The company acquired the Boeing 737-200 later that year, making it the first airline to use the Boeing 737 a central component of its fleet (“United Airlines”). United eventually developed into one of America’s most popular airline companies, catalyzing the popularity of air travel.
America’s fervor for flying, made obvious in the photograph by the family’s fascination with their surrounding environment, originated with the invention of the airplane at the turn of the twentieth century. This was in large part because of the Wright brothers in the early 1900s, with their first successful flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (Johnson 16). The faster travel times were a chief advantage, as opposed to slower vehicular and animal commuting. In addition, the opportunity of flying thousands of feet in the air made this form of transportation more intriguing. As a result, the Wright brothers were viewed as legends of flight and gained popularity worldwide (17). This new mode of transportation progressed into a desirable luxury.
At the time of this photograph in the 1960s, flying was a special occasion that only the upper middle-class and wealthy could afford to regularly experience. Passengers would dress up for their trips, and treated the process as an important and fancy outing (McManis). 	
Los Angeles International Airport itself was an admirable place.  The architect Gin Wong designed the facility as a future landmark, which included the uniquely shaped and iconic “Theme Building”. In addition, the 1961 Airport Traffic Control Tower and Terminal 3 were both built around the time the photo was taken (“Cultural Resources”). The fascination with the newly constructed airport, along with the burgeoning popularity of United Airlines and their massive planes, may explain the children’s demonstrated interest with the United aircraft flying overhead in the Aviation Boulevard image.
